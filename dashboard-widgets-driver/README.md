## Install and usage
1. **Install "Dashboard Widgets" package using [HPM](https://hubitatpackagemanager.hubitatcommunity.com/)**\
   This action will:
   * install the "Dashboard Widgets" device driver
   * add HTML files for each widget into the Hubitat File Manager
3. **Create a new Virtual Device**
   * Go to "Devices"
   * Click "Add Device" in the top right
   * Select "Virtual"
   * Give the device a name (e.g.: "Dashboard Widgets")
   * From the "Type" dropdown, select "Dashboard Widgets"
   * Click "Save Device"
4. **Enable Maker API integration**
   * Go to the newly added device page
   * In the "Preferences" section, enable the "Use Maker API" option
   * Click "Save Preferences"
   * Make sure that the "Maker API link" field is corectly configured; the driver will try to guess this value but, if it fails, follow the provided instructions to retreive the correct value
   * Click again "Save Preferences"
5. **Assign widgets to the device attributes**\
   The newly added device exports a fixed list of HTML attributes "Alfa", "Bravo", "Charlie", etc. For each of these attributes, you can configure and assign widgets (one per attribute).

   * In the "Pick an Attribute" section, select one of the attributes you configured in Step 4 (e.g.: "Alfa")
  
## Responsive tiles
Widgets are responsive, they will automatically scale if you modify the dashboard tile size. There is however a small bug that prevents this from happening; to fix it, follow these steps:
* Go to "Dashboards"
* Select the dashboard you authorized in Step 5
* Click the cogwheel icon in the top right to open dashboard settings
* Click "Advanced"
* Click "CSS"
* Enter the following code in the text area below:
  ```css
  .tile-primary { height: 100% }
  ```
* Finally, click "Save CSS"
